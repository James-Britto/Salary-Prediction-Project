# Salary Prediction Project
							Salary Prediction Project
**Problem Statement:**

In today's competitive job market, it is crucial for both employers and job seekers to have an accurate understanding of salary expectations. Many factors influence salary levels, including education, experience, job role, age and industry. Therefore, the aim of this project is to develop a salary prediction model that can provide reliable estimates of salary based on various input features.

**Project Objectives:**

**Data Collection:** Gather a comprehensive dataset containing information about job seekers and their corresponding salaries. The dataset should include features such as education, years of experience, job role and age.

**Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. Perform feature engineering if necessary to create meaningful input features for the prediction model.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct an in-depth analysis of the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between different features and salary levels. Visualize key trends and correlations.

**Model Selection:** Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for salary prediction. Consider regression techniques since this is a regression problem. Experiment with different algorithms and evaluate their performance using suitable metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, R2 score).

**Feature Importance:** Determine which features have the most significant impact on salary predictions. This information can help both job seekers and employers understand the factors driving salary levels.

**Model Interpretability:** Make the model interpretable by providing explanations for salary predictions. This can enhance trust and understanding of the model's predictions.

**Deployment:** Develop a user-friendly interface or application where users can input their information, and the model will provide a salary estimate based on the trained model.

**Testing and Validation:** Thoroughly test the model with different datasets to ensure its robustness and reliability. Validate the model's predictions against real-world salary data.

**Documentation:** Create comprehensive documentation that explains the project's methodology, data sources, model architecture, and how to use the deployed salary prediction tool.

**User Feedback and Improvement:** Collect feedback from users and stakeholders to continuously improve the model and its user interface. Implement updates and enhancements as needed.

**Deliverables:**
